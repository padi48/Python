-ABOUT ME-
Hi, my name is Máté. I'm a 19 years old High School student in Hungary. 
I'm learning programming by myself, from YouTube videos, or other websites. I make lots of projects for exercise, because in my opinion it's the best way to learn.
I'm passionate about programming, although it's a bit hard to learn it alone. :)
